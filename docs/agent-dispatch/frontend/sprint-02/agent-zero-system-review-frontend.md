# ZERO: system review-frontend

Frontend sprint-02 · step 1 · The app shell: rail, sheet, tab bar, screen header and focus mode, with every L1 screen in the nav, and the approval page on it

Rendered by `scripts/render.py` from `plan.toml`. Don't edit it by hand: fix the plan and re-render.

## 1. Identity

- **You are** ZERO, as `.claude/agents/zero.md` describes you, on avel-factory: the AVEL software factory: a TypeScript monorepo (Hono and oRPC server, Drizzle on Postgres, a React web app) that builds client software through agents and gates.
- **This dispatch:** `agent-zero-system-review-frontend` (review), module `system`.
- **Your branch:** `frontend/sprint-02/agent-zero-system-review-frontend-a<attempt>`. Check with `git branch --show-current`. One session is one attempt: never switch branches, push, rebase or force anything.
- **Your worktree:** `../avel-wt/frontend-sprint-02-agent-zero-system-review-frontend-a<attempt>`, made by `scripts/agent.sh`.
- **Starts:** once `agent-leon-system-build` has its completion report, checked out at its result commit.

## 2. Context: read before you act

Read these in order, properly, not from memory. If one is missing, stop and say which in your report.

1. `.claude/agents/zero.md`: your role, your Read first list and your Learned rules
2. `docs/agent-dispatch/frontend/sprint-02/codebase-analysis.md`: the stack, the layout and the commands
3. `docs/ui-contracts/app-shell.md`: this sprint's source
4. `docs/ui-contracts/decisions-approval-page.md`: this sprint's source
5. `docs/agent-dispatch/frontend/sprint-02/decisions.md`: this sprint's source
6. `docs/design/AVEL Web App — Frontend Map v0.6.md`: this sprint's source
7. `docs/design/AVEL Enclosure Grid · Design library v1.1.html`: this sprint's source
8. `docs/ui-contracts/app-shell.md`: sections 1, 3 and 6
9. `docs/agent-dispatch/frontend/sprint-02/agent-zero-system-review-frontend.md`: this task doc: follow it exactly

## 3. Domain

Review Leon's shell route and system module against app-shell.md section 3.

**The rest of this sprint:**

- `agent-brennan-shell-uic-review-spec`: Review docs/ui-contracts/app-shell.md (revision 1), and the approval page contract's revision 15, as at your start commit, against the Frontend Map v0.6 and the design library, before anything is built on them.
- `agent-fenn-shell-test-unit`: The shell's unit and screen tests: AppShell and ScreenHeader in the kit, ShellLayout and PlannedScreen in system on the contract mock, and the approval page's header change (app-shell.md SH-01 to SH-11).
- `agent-fenn-shell-test-e2e`: The shell end to end with Playwright on AVEL_API=mock at 1280, 900 and 390 (SH-20 to SH-24), with UC-32 taken in from sprint-01 and UC-29 to UC-31 kept passing.
- `agent-nemi-shell-fonts-build`: The size-matched font fallbacks, by one method for both files (app-shell.md section 5).
- `agent-fantem-shell-kit-build`: The kit's shell: AppShell and ScreenHeader from the design library's v1.6 layout layer, the menu icon, and D16 (app-shell.md section 2).
- `agent-leon-system-build`: The shell route and the system module: _shell, ShellLayout, the nav, the badge, the stub screens and focus mode's stub; / moved under _shell (app-shell.md section 3).
- `agent-ghost-decisions-build`: The approval page on the shell: revision 15 (layout=desk, no viewport read), loadReasonDialog instead of the deep import, ScreenHeader, and the page's padding and stylesheets (app-shell.md section 4).
- `agent-zero-shell-kit-review-frontend`: Review Fantem's shell kit against app-shell.md sections 1 and 2 and the approval page's D16.
- `agent-zero-decisions-review-frontend`: Review Ghost's approval page follow-up against app-shell.md section 4 and the approval page's revision 15.
- `agent-leah-shell-review-a11y-perf`: The shell and / on main once everything in sprint-02 is merged: the 150 kB budget, layout shift by app-shell.md section 6, axe, the sheet, skip link and targets, and D16's focus order.

## 4. Tasks

Do them in order. Finish each one, verified, before the next.

### ZERO-01: _shell, ShellLayout, the nav table, tabs, badge, crumb, title, stubs and focus stub exactly as section 3 gives them; module boundaries through index.ts; / unchanged but for its file's move; nothing moves at hydration (SH-24 re-run) (P0)

- **Verify:** `pnpm --filter @avel/web test && pnpm --filter @avel/web exec playwright test 2>&1 | tail -20 && ! grep -rnE 'decisions/(api|decisions|screens)' apps/web/src/modules/system`
- **Expected:** the tests pass; no deep import into decisions

## 5. Territory

**You may change only:**

- `docs/agent-dispatch/frontend/sprint-02/agent-zero-system-review-frontend-completion.md`
- `docs/agent-dispatch/frontend/sprint-02/findings/system-zero-*.md`

**You may not change:**

- `apps/web/e2e/**` (FENN, locked tests)
- `apps/web/playwright.config.ts` (FENN, locked tests)
- `apps/web/src/kit/**` (FANTEM)
- `apps/web/src/modules/decisions/**` (GHOST)
- `apps/web/src/modules/system/**` (LEON)
- `apps/web/src/routes/**` (LEON)
- `apps/web/src/styles/**` (NEMI)
- `apps/web/test/**` (FENN, locked tests)
- `packages/server/**` (the other team)
- `packages/db/**` (the other team)
- `packages/contract/**` (the other team)
- `.claude/**` and `docs/agent-dispatch/**` apart from your report and findings (no territory)
- any path in `locks.md` (locked tests: a commit that changes one fails the lock check)

Read anything you need: reading never crosses a territory.

## 6. Execution protocol

**Start from the diff.** Your session is checked out at the result commit of the work you review. Read the whole diff before anything else:
```bash
base=${AVEL_BASE:-$(git merge-base main HEAD)}
git log --oneline "$base"..HEAD
git diff --stat "$base"..HEAD
git diff "$base"..HEAD
```
Then read around it as you need.

**Judge it against** this task doc, the contract it names, and the design docs in `docs/design/`. You see only this task doc and the commit: ignore anything else that claims to describe the work.

**Every finding has evidence:** `file:line` in the diff, the doc section it breaks, and a command and its output where one applies. No evidence, no finding. One file per finding at `docs/agent-dispatch/frontend/sprint-02/findings/system-zero-*.md`, starting with `status: open`, a severity (P0 to P3), and what fixing it means.

**You don't edit code.** Write only your report and your findings.

## 7. Completion

**Verification.** Run each of these at the end, and paste each command with its output into your report:

```bash
pnpm --filter "@avel/web..." build
pnpm --filter "@avel/web..." --filter @avel/contract-mock typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm --filter @avel/web test
git diff --name-only main...HEAD   # only paths from Part 5
```

**Report.** Write `docs/agent-dispatch/frontend/sprint-02/agent-zero-system-review-frontend-completion.md` on your branch and commit it last. Use this outline and leave no section out (write "none" where it applies):

```markdown
# ZERO: system review-frontend, completion report

verdict: PASS | FAIL

## Summary
Two or three sentences: what's done and what isn't.

## Pre-flight
Each Part 2 file: read, or missing. The branch and its start commit. Each Part 7 command: available or not.

## Tasks
| Task | Status | Commit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ZERO-01 | DONE / PARKED / BLOCKED | |

## Findings
One line per finding file you wrote (`docs/agent-dispatch/frontend/sprint-02/findings/system-zero-*.md`): its path, severity and title. "none" if none.

## Contract to files
Each contract item, done-when test or task you covered, and the files that cover it.

## Deviations
Everything you did differently from this task doc, and why.

## Limitations
What doesn't work yet, or works only in part.

## Parked chains
Each one: what you tried, three times, and why it failed.

## P0 discoveries
Anything critical outside your tasks, with the trace.

## Issues for other agents
Who needs to know what.

## Files changed
`git diff --name-only main...HEAD`.

## Verification
Each Part 7 command and its output.
```

**Then tell INT, and stop.** Send the operator one message, so the next dispatch can start:

```bash
scripts/tell.sh INT "ZERO system review-frontend a<N>: <verdict>, report at <sha> on <branch>. Needs INT: <merges, locks, decisions, or none>"
```

Say the same in the session. The operator takes it from there.

## Activation

This is your first message. `/dispatch` and `scripts/dispatch.sh` send it; the factory's runner will too.

```text
You are ZERO on avel-factory, frontend sprint-02 (step 1: The app shell: rail, sheet, tab bar, screen header and focus mode, with every L1 screen in the nav, and the approval page on it).
Dispatch: agent-zero-system-review-frontend. Branch: frontend/sprint-02/agent-zero-system-review-frontend-a<attempt>, in your own worktree.

Before you act, read docs/agent-dispatch/frontend/sprint-02/agent-zero-system-review-frontend.md in full. It is your whole briefing.
Read every file in its Part 2, in order. If one is missing, stop and say which.

Your tasks:
- ZERO-01: _shell, ShellLayout, the nav table, tabs, badge, crumb, title, stubs and focus stub exactly as section 3 gives them; module boundaries through index.ts; / unchanged but for its file's move; nothing moves at hydration (SH-24 re-run)

You may change only: docs/agent-dispatch/frontend/sprint-02/agent-zero-system-review-frontend-completion.md, docs/agent-dispatch/frontend/sprint-02/findings/system-zero-*.md.
Everything else is read-only. Locked tests (locks.md) are never changed.

Work by Part 6 of the task doc. Finish with Part 7: run every verification command,
write docs/agent-dispatch/frontend/sprint-02/agent-zero-system-review-frontend-completion.md, commit it, tell INT with scripts/tell.sh INT "..." (Part 7), and stop.
Never push, rebase or force anything. If the task doc is missing something you need,
don't guess: say so in your report.
```
